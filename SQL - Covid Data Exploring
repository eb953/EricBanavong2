-- Analyzing Covid-19 Data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
-- Using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 

-- Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types


-- Data to be analyzed 

Select Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
From Portfolio..CovidDeaths
Order by 1,2 


-- Total Cases vs Total Deaths in the United States. Showing likelihood to die from Covid if contracted

Select Location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (cast (total_deaths AS float) / cast(total_cases as float))*100 as DeathPercentage
From Portfolio..CovidDeaths
Where location like '%states%'
Order by 1,2


-- Total Cases vs Population. Finding out what percent of the United States population has contracted covid

Select Location, date, total_cases, population, (cast(total_cases as float) / population) * 100 AS PercentCovidContraction
From Portfolio..CovidDeaths
Where location like '%states%'
Order by 1,2


-- Looking at countries with highest infection rate compared to population 

Select Location, Max(total_cases) as MaximumInfectionCount, population, Max((cast(total_cases as float) / population)) * 100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
From Portfolio..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
Group by Location, Population
Order by PercentPopulationInfected desc


--Showing Countries with highest death count per population 

Select Location, Max(total_deaths) as MaximumDeathCount, population, Max((cast(total_deaths as float) / population)) * 100 AS PercentDied
From Portfolio..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
Group by Location, Population
Order by PercentDied desc


--Showing Countries with highest death count per population 

Select Location, Max(total_deaths) as TotalDeathCount
From Portfolio..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
Where continent is not null
Group by Location 
Order by TotalDeathCount desc

-- Continue above query by breaking down result by continent 

Select continent, Max(total_deaths) as TotalDeathCount
From Portfolio..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null
Group by continent 
Order by TotalDeathCount desc



-- Global Numbers, collecting total cases, total deaths, and percentage of global population that has died from Covid

Select Sum(new_cases) as total_cases, sum(new_deaths) as total_deaths, Sum(cast(new_deaths as float)) / Sum(cast(new_cases as float)) *100 as DeathPercentage
From Portfolio..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null

--Joining 2 tables, Looking at total population vs vaccinations. Create a rolling count that shows percentage of population that has recieved at least one vaccine. 
Either CTE or Temp table can be used to accomplish this on the below query. 

Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
From Portfolio..CovidVaccinations vac
Join Portfolio..CovidDeaths dea
on dea.location = vac.location
and dea.date = vac.date
Where dea.continent is not null 
order by 2,3

--USE CTE

With PopVsVacc (Continent, Location, Date, Population, new_vaccinations, RollingPeopleVaccinated)
as 
(
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, Sum(cast(vac.new_vaccinations as bigint)) OVER (Partition by dea.location Order by dea.location, dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From Portfolio..CovidVaccinations vac
Join Portfolio..CovidDeaths dea
on dea.location = vac.location
and dea.date = vac.date
Where dea.continent is not null 
)
Select *, (cast(RollingPeopleVaccinated as float) / cast(Population as float)) *100
From PopvsVacc



--Use Temp Table on previous query

Drop Table if exists #PercentPopulationVaccinated 
Create Table #PercentPopulationVaccinated 

(
Continent nvarchar(255),
